# Welcome to the Realtime Whiteboard Code Repository!

This repository showcases an interactive whiteboard application built using Node.js and React.js. The application allows users to collaborate in real-time, drawing and writing on a virtual canvas, making it ideal for remote team collaboration, online tutoring, brainstorming sessions, and more.

## Features:

1. Real-time collaboration: Multiple users can draw, write, and interact with the whiteboard simultaneously in real-time, enabling seamless collaboration.
2. Responsive and intuitive UI: The user-friendly interface provides a smooth and responsive drawing experience, with a wide range of colors, brush sizes, and shapes to choose from.
3. Real-time updates: Changes made by any user are instantly updated on the canvas for all other users, ensuring that everyone is always on the same page.
4. User management: The application supports user authentication and authorization, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and join specific whiteboard sessions.
5. Persistence: The whiteboard data is persistently stored in the backend, enabling users to save and reload their work even after closing and reopening the application.
6. Error handling: The application includes robust error handling to ensure smooth operation, with informative error messages and fallbacks for unexpected scenarios.

## Technologies Used:

1. Node.js: Provides the backend server for handling real-time updates, user authentication, and data persistence.
2. React.js: Offers a performant and interactive user interface for drawing and interacting with the whiteboard in real-time.
3. WebSockets: Enables real-time communication between the server and clients for seamless collaboration.
4. MongoDB: Used for data persistence, storing whiteboard data and user information securely.
5. Roughjs: Used to draw in a sketchy and hand written style
